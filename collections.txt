SCALA COLLECTION

USING MAP
	//List of strings
	val myList =List("one","two","three","four")
    // Map  function iterates through the list
	// The function what we have here is an anonymous function
	val mapped =myList.map( s => s.toUpperCase())
	
USING FLATMAP
similar to map, however it is a higher order function
It unboxes the returned results
Note
None: is an option type T which returns nothing
Some: is of type T is some(s). Here it returns the string
Option:Invaluable part of scala which allows us to control our code easier to avoid using nulls and checking for nulls
        Option of T has 2 possible types either None or some(of that type)

    val flatMap=myList.flatMap { s=>
	val filters=List("one","four")
	  if(filters.contains(s))
		None
	  else
		Some(s)
}
